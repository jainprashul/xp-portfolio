# Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

## Introduction / Problem
Clear and consistent Pull Requests (PRs) are essential for effective code review, collaboration, and project maintainability. This rule defines the conventions and best practices for creating PRs in this repository.

## Pattern Description

### PR Title
- Use a concise, descriptive title that summarizes the change.
- Prefix with the type of change (e.g., `Feature:`, `Fix:`, `Refactor:`, `Chore:`).
- Reference the main ticket/issue if applicable (e.g., `MCS-123`).
- Example: `Feature: Add PLMN Options to AlertProfileForm (MCS-889)`

### PR Description Structure
Use the following structure in your PR description:

```markdown
# <Type>: <Short Description> (<Ticket/Issue>)

## Context
Briefly explain the motivation, background, or problem being solved.

## Key Changes
- List the main changes, features, or fixes introduced.
- Use bullet points for clarity.

## Fixed Issue
- Fix [MCS-123](mdc:orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/https:/your-jira-instance/browse/MCS-123) (if applicable)

---
This PR is ready to be merged into `main` and will improve the codebase as described above.
```

### Best Practices
- Keep PRs focused: group related changes together, avoid unrelated changes.
- Write clear, actionable commit messages.
- Reference related issues or tickets in the description.
- Use Markdown formatting for readability.
- Summarize testing or validation steps if relevant.
- If the PR is large, consider breaking it into smaller, reviewable parts.

## Real-World Examples
- [Feature: Add PLMN Options to AlertProfileForm (MCS-889)](mdc:orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/path/to/pr-example.md)
- [Fix: Update health status handling in RadioPin (MCS-949)](mdc:orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/orch-ui/path/to/pr-example2.md)

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague or generic titles (e.g., `Update code`)
- Missing context or motivation in the description
- Mixing unrelated changes in a single PR
- Not referencing the relevant ticket/issue

## Note

- Make sure to return the PR in github markdown format that can be directly copy pasted to PR body.
